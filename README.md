**🚀 Future Plans 🚀**
These are a few of the features planned for this project!
  - Adding users, managing their borrowing history.
  - Allowing users to see their own borrowing history and the return date for each book.
  - Keeping track of the books available and showing whether they are available or not, adding or removing books from inventory.
  - Allowing users to search for books based on title, author and genre.
  - Generating a fine in case the book is damaged or lost, based on it's price.
  - And others!



*👨‍💻This project is being developed by a single person (me, vwanako!) as a study project for developing my C++ skills. I don't have any plans on releasing it as a real piece of software.*
